		<h1>Segway'n USA</h1>
		<p>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!</p>
		
		<h2>August 20, 2012</h2>

		<p>Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
			Walla walla,WA; Magic city,ID; Bountiful,ut; Last Chance,CO; why, AZ and Truth or consequences, NM
		</p>
			
		<h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
		<p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</p>
		<blockquote>					<!--blockquote为块元素引用，下方的q为内联元素引用-->
			Passing cars,<br>			<!--<br>为换行符-->
			When you can't see,<br>
			May get you,<br>
			A glimpse,<br>
			Of eternity.  
		</blockquote>	
		<p>I definitely won't be passing any cars.</p>
		
		<h2>June 2, 2012</h2>
		<img src='imgs/segway1.jpg'>
		<p> My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
		cell phone, ipod, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step Segway</q>.</p>
